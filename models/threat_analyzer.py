Threat Analyzer for Spamlyser Pro - Multi-class Threat Analysis Module

This module enhances Spamlyser's binary classification (SPAM/HAM) by adding
multi-class threat categorization capabilities. It analyzes messages to determine
the specific type of threat they represent.

Threat Categories:
- ðŸŽ£ Phishing: Messages designed to steal sensitive information
- ðŸ’¸ Scam/Fraud: Deceptive messages aimed at tricking the user into sending money
- ðŸ“¢ Unwanted Marketing: Legitimate but unsolicited advertising or promotional content
- ðŸ¤– Other: A general category for spam that doesn't fit neatly into the others
